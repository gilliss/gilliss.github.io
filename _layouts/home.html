                <b>Research Interests</b> <br>
                I focus on data analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, and hardware systems development, with applications in radiation detection and measurement. Most recently, my dissertation applies Bayesian statistical modeling and MCMC techniques to nuclear spectroscopic measurements. I have interests in

                <b>Brief Bio</b> <br>
                I am a PhD student in <a href="https://physics.unc.edu/">UNC</a>'s <a href="http://enapphysics.web.unc.edu/">Experimental Nuclear and Astroparticle Physics</a> (ENAP) group. While at UNC, I joined the <a href="https://www.npl.washington.edu/majorana/">MAJORANA</a> and <a href="http://legend-exp.org/">LEGEND</a> Collaborations, both germanium-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_beta_decay">neutrinoless double-beta decay</a> experiments studying the neutrino, an elementary particle involved in interactions of the weak nuclear force. Outside of research, I am actively involved in community outreach and science communication. I am a Science Ambassador at the <a href="http://moreheadplanetarium.org/">Morehead Planetarium and Science Center</a>, and hold a bachelor's degree in physics from <a href="https://www.wooster.edu/">The College of Wooster</a>.
