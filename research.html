	<ul>
        <li> <p><b>Operator Scheduling in a Multicore Distributed Stream Processing Engine (July '15 - Current) </b> <br>
              <i>Guide: Dr. Ganesan Ramalingam, Microsoft Research India </i> <br> The CScale project explores new designs of distributed databases. As part of this project, we have developed a new replication protocol for building consistent and resilient distributed data structures.

        <li> <p> <b>Improving Read Performance in Write-Optimized Key Value Stores (Jan '15 - Current) </b> <br>
             <i>Guide: Prof. S. Sudarshan, IIT Bombay </i> <br>
             Indexing techniques optimized for a higher write throughput such as LSM Trees generally compromise on read performance. We are working on designing and implementing an indexing technique optimized for both read and write latencies on HBase, an open source implementation of Google's Big Table </p></li>
        <li> <p> <b>Automated Linguistic Personalization of Ad Messages (May '14 - July '14) </b> <br>
             <i>Guide: Dr. Rishiraj Saha Roy, Max Planck Institute for Informatics </i> <br>
             Designed and developed a novel method of personalizing ad messages based on the linguisticstyle of a target segment identified by age, gender, occupation, location. Extracted appropriate modifiers from advertisements and inserted them in the text to decrease cross entropy with language model of target segment </p></li>
        <li><p><b>Synthesis Modulo Bisimulation of Distributed Automaton Systems (Dec '13 - Feb '14) </b> <br>
            <i>Guide: Prof. Madhavan Mukund, Chennai Mathematical Institute </i> <br> 
            We are working on the open problem of synthesizing distributed transition systems from global specifications with bisimulation as equivalence criterion. We have gathered evidence that the collapse in state space when one obtains the bisimulation quotient of the distributed transition system can be quantified </p></li>
        <li><p><b>L2 Readability Analysis (Aug '14 - Dec '14)</b> <br>
            <i>Guide: Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharya, IIT Bombay </i> <br>
            Performed a complete study of existing techniques in estimating readability of a text, in particular for second language learners. Created benchmark metric for readability for Indian L2 learners based on NCERT textbooks for grade levels from 4 to 12</p></li>

	<p class="section-title">Key Course Projects</p>
	<ul>
    <li><p> <b>Cost Metric for Query Optimization (Oct-Dec 2014)</b><br>
      <i>Guide: Prof. S. Sudarshan, IIT Bombay</i><br>
      Enhanced size estimation using additional histogram information and thereby the efficiency of the cost metric in the PyroJ query optimizer to achieve resourceful plans for execution </p> </li>
    <li><p><b>Virutal Memory Management System (Mar-Apr 2014) </b> <br>
        <i>Guide: Prof. Dhananjay Damdhere, IIT Bombay </i> <br>
        Developed multi-level page table virtual memory management for an UNIX-based OS. Designed and implemented efficient data structures and algorithms for handling process memory allocation, swap space management and page replacement strategies </p></li>
    <li><p><b>Parallel Processing in Multi-core Architectures (Oct-Dec 2013)</b><br>
      <i>Guide: Prof. Bernard Menezes, IIT Bombay </i><br>
      Analyzed performance gains in multi core architecture for representative problems such as Merge Sort, Matrix Multiplication, Monte-Carlo Simulation and the Bellman Ford algorithm. Estimated the degree of parallelism through techniques such as the Karp Flatt metric </p> </li>
    <li><p><b>Control Flow Graph Language Processor (Feb-Apr 2014)</b><br>
      <i>Guide: Prof. Udhay Khedkar, IIT Bombay</i><br>
      Developed a language processor for control flow graph dumps generated by gcc. Implemented a compiler as well as an interpreter for the language </p></li>
    <li><p><b>Inferring Power Relations from Social Interactions (Feb-Apr 2014)</b><br>
      <i>Guide: Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharya, IIT Bombay </i> <br>
      Studied how conversational behaviour in social interactions can reveal power relations among participants. Explored efficacy of various learning models in characterizing linguistic styles impacted by power differentials </p></li>
